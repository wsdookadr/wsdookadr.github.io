Because I split my time across multiple projects, and sometimes I have a dedicated laptop for one project, I find this setup to be useful.
For some time I’ve wanted to take a closer look at how exactly I spend my time during the day, for both personal projects and client work.
I’ve tried other solutions in the past but they didn’t work very well.</description></item><item><title>Setting up the new blog</title><link>https://wsdookadr.github.io/posts/p1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wsdookadr.github.io/posts/p1/</guid><description>Previous setup Previously I was writing a blog using the following: Emacs + Org-Mode + Jekyll. Here is a short assessment of that setup:
The pros:
Emacs tries to pack as much functionality as possible without the need for external dependencies
Org-Mode allows you to have runnable code blocks and include the results of said code blocks inside the rendered version of the documents. The active document concept is really nice (but nowadays that’s also achievable with Jupyter)</description></item></channel></rss>
