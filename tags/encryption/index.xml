When the work is done, I generate the invoice based on the time spent on the project, and I have to ship the deliverables.
Recently I’ve been working on a C# project, and I use a Windows10 laptop where I happen to have a WSL installed.
I could set up a continuous integration (CI) environment to trigger builds for every commit, and have the binaries available in some artifact repository, or I could set up a file server for this and use scp or sftp, but again, that’s not the case.</description></item></channel></rss>
