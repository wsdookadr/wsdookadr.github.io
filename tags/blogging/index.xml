Emacs tries to pack as much functionality as possible without the need for external dependencies
Org-Mode allows you to have runnable code blocks and include the results of said code blocks inside the rendered version of the documents. The active document concept is really nice (but nowadays thatâ€™s also achievable with Jupyter)</description></item></channel></rss>
