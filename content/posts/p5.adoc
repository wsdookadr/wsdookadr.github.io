== Intro

This post describes ways to download, clip and join satellite images. The module link:https://github.com/wsdookadr/sentinel-mosaic[`sentinel-mosaic`] is
used throughout this blog post.

== Background

There's a number of satellites launched by the European
Space Agency that take images of Earth which are then sent
to ground stations and made publicly available through the
link:https://scihub.copernicus.eu/[Copernicus Open Access Hub] and its
respective API.

In this post we're focusing mainly on the data
from `Sentinel-2A` and `Sentinel-2B` which were
designed for multiple purposes, one of those purposes being
link:https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2/mission-objectives[land monitoring].

Here are some of the other satellites together with their launch dates
and lifespans.

The Copernicus Hub has a link:https://scihub.copernicus.eu/userguide/LongTermArchive[data retention policy].
The policy states that data is readily available for download for the past 12 months, and older data downloads
can be triggered and downloaded within 24 hours.

== Setup

The following libraries are required. We're installing them through the
`conda` package manager that comes with the Anaconda3 Python distribution.
There's a link:https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.11-Windows-x86_64.exe[Windows installer] and a link:https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.11-Linux-x86_64.sh[Linux installer].

The nice part about Anaconda3 is that they offer curated versions of
these packages and their package manager takes care of external libraries as well.
This makes the install much easier, so fixes like the one I had to do link:/posts/p4/#_installing_geopandas_and_dependencies[for Geopandas] here
when it was installed directly from PyPi are not necessary anymore.

|===

In order to install these, create a new environment, switch to it and then
install the packages.

[source,bash]
----
conda create -n e3 python=3.8.5
conda activate e3
conda install rasterio==1.2.1 sentinelsat==0.14 shapely==1.7.1
conda install gdal==3.1.4 geopandas==0.9.0 matplotlib==3.4.0 jupyter==1.0.0
----

Now also install the sentinel-utils package

[source,bash]
----
pip install sentinel-utils
----

== Summary of the full algorithm

The steps are the following:

. Reading the input data (the region of interest) from a GeoJSON file
. Querying the Sentinel API to get the tiles that intersect the region of interest
. Removing redundant granules I 
. Removing redundant granules II
. Downloading the reduced set of granules (multiple zip archives stored on disk)
. Unpacking the archives
. Raster conversion `JP2OpenJPEG` -> `GeoTiff`
. Joining all the raster images `TCI` (True Color) into one big image
. Reprojecting the image to `EPSG:4326`
. Clipping the region of interest from the big image

== Removing redundant granules

One of the problems I noticed when dealing with the metadata returned
by the Sentinel API was that it returns overlapping granules. This is
because the overlapping images were actually taken on different orbits
of the satellites over the same area.

Further, here's a small table describing the types of images that you
can expect to get back:

So in order to minimize the amount of data you download, we can decide
which of the granules covering the area of interest we want to download
(depending on the attributes of each granule). Reducing these images
also helps later on with the other steps (the less images we're joining/reprojecting,
the less time it will take).

.1 Input data

image::/posts/p5-algo-1-1.png[width=70%,scalewidth=50%]

.2 Union of all polygons

image::/posts/p5-algo-1-2.png[width=70%,scalewidth=50%]

.3 After removing redundant polygons
image::/posts/p5-algo-1-3.png[scalewidth=50%]

{nbsp}

This algorithm goes through all polygons and adds them to union_poly
only if they're not already contained in `union_poly` (in other words,
we're only adding them to `union_poly` if they can increase the total area covered).

In the code below, `ps` is the set of polygons used as input.

[source%linenums,python3]
----
union_poly = ps[0]
union_parts = [ps[0],]
for p in ps[1:]:
    common = union_poly.intersection(p)
    if p.area - common.area < 0.001:
        pass
    else:
        union_parts.append(p)
        union_poly = union_poly.union(p)
----

== The area of interest

The area of interest is a polygon (you can draw one yourself on link:http://geojson.io/[geojson.io]) that describes the final area we want clipped from the granules.
Here are two examples, one of
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluj-Napoca[Cluj-Napoca], and the other of link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid[Madrid].

== Results

The dates at which the images were taken will matter, because even though
the adjacent images will match (and you can see this by looking at rivers
or roads continuing from one image to next one), the colors can differ
a lot if the images were taken in different seasons (for example one in
autumn and one during winter).

Here are results from intermediary and final steps (you can zoom-in a lot, they're very large):
