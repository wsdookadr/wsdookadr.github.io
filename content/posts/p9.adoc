I came across this problem recently:

image::/posts/p9-problem.png[]

It's about a square that gets partitioned into rectangles
of equal area (some sources call this 
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floorplan_(microelectronics)["floorplan"] ).

One of the sides of these smaller rectangles is given and the problem
asks for the area of the large square.

It's possible to build equations for: 

. the known side of the small rectangle
. the smaller rectangle sides that add up to the same length of the large square side-length
. the areas of the smaller rectangles being equal

I thought of writing them out by hand but then realized it would be possible
to just generate the equations (even if some of them might be redundant).

# o,y,p,b,g
from sympy import *
ow,oh,yw,yh,pw,ph,bw,bh,gw,gh = symbols('o_w o_h y_w y_h p_w p_h b_w b_h g_w g_h')
u1 = ow+bw
u2 = yw+pw+bw
u3 = oh+yh
u4 = bh
u5 = oh+gh+ph
u6 = yw+gw+bw
P = [ow*oh,yw*yh,pw*ph,bw*bh,gw*gh]
U=[u1,u2,u3,u4,u5,u6]
l=len(U)
E=[]
E.append(Eq(oh,3))
for i in range(l):
    for j in range(i):
        e = U[i]-U[j]
        E.append(Eq(e,0))
l=len(P)
for i in range(l):
    for j in range(i):
        e = P[i]-P[j]
        E.append(Eq(e,0))
S = solve(E)
print(S)
L = 3 + S[0][yh]
print("L=",L)

This will build a system of equations which is then passed to SymPy.

After it's solved, we can get the length of the square by adding 3 to
the yellow height.
