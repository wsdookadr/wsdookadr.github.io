Having used Jekyll before to write a blog, I saw link:https://pages.github.com/[Github Pages] is quite mainstream
nowadays, so I thought of giving it a try.

Together with link:https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-github-pages[Github Deploy Actions] it actually automates
a lot of the workflow nicely and I'm actually able to just write markup in link:https://asciidoc.org/userguide.html[asciidoc]
and push to the blog repo and have it be compiled and see the changes soon after.
